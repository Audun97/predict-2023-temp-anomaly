# Predict 2023 temperature anomaly
This is a set of scripts used to predict the global 2023 temperature anomaly using [NOAA data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series) for entire year and Jan-Jul anomalies.

The multivariate linerar regression does not take into account the El Nino event making its prediction quite bad.
